ðŸ”˜ **Introduction**

This analysis introduces a well-designed dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of key COVID-19 metrics on a global scale. The dashboard offers real-time updates on infection rates, vaccination progress, hospitalization and healthcare capacity, testing and positivity rates, and global travel restrictions. With its user-friendly interface and interactive visualizations, this dashboard serves as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations seeking to track and understand the impact of the pandemic worldwide.

ðŸ”˜ **Aim of the study**

The aim of this study is to create a uniquely designed dashboard that offers a concise and comprehensive overview of key COVID-19 metrics, providing individuals and organizations with a powerful tool to track and understand the global impact of the pandemic.

ðŸ”˜ **Data Description**

The CSV contains data with the following columns:

1. Continent: Represents the continent to which a particular country belongs.
2. Country: Indicates the name of the country within the corresponding continent.
3. Population: Represents the population of the continent to which the country belongs.
4. Cases Found by Month: Provides the number of COVID-19 cases found in each month.
5. Deaths: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19.
6. Age: Indicates the age range in which the COVID-19 virus is spreading.
7. Year: Represents the year for which the data is recorded.

This dataset offers information on the COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and demographic factors such as age, organized by continent and country. It provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on different regions, allowing for analysis and insights into the spread of the virus across various demographic groups and geographical locations.

ðŸ”˜ **Methodolgy**

The project involves collecting and processing Covid-19 data, and utilized Microsoft Power BI dashboard to gain insights which will showcase the worldwide covid-19 metrics.

ðŸ”˜ **Dashboard**

The created dashboard provides a concise summary of key COVID-19 metrics, showcasing the median age by continent, distribution of total cases on a map chart, and highlighting the top 5 countries by total cases and total deaths. Additionally, it presents the total deaths categorized by continent, offering a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact across different regions.

ðŸ”˜ **Findings**

1. Impact of COVID-19: The total number of cases across all continents amounts to a staggering 191 million, with 529,000 reported deaths.
2. Geographical Impact: Asia and Europe have the highest number of cases, while Europe and South America experienced the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19.
3. Age Distribution: In Europe, the median age of individuals affected by COVID-19 falls within the 40-50 age group, while in other continents, it predominantly affects individuals aged 20-30.
4. Top Affected Countries: The top five countries by total cases are Brazil, France, India, Russia, and the United States. The top five countries by total deaths are the United States, Brazil, India, Mexico, and Peru.

These insights highlight the widespread impact of COVID-19, the varying age distribution among affected individuals, and the significant burden faced by specific countries in terms of both cases and deaths.

ðŸ”˜ **Summary**

The analysis conducted using Power BI on the COVID-19 dataset aimed to gain insights into the pandemic's impact and patterns. The dashboard provided valuable information on COVID-19 cases and deaths by continent, age distribution of affected individuals, and top affected countries. These insights can guide decision-making, resource allocation, and interventions to effectively mitigate the spread of the virus and reduce its impact globally.

ðŸ”˜ **Challenges Faced**

Encountered challenges such as availability and reliability of COVID-19 data, noise value in the data, choosing proper charts, removing redudant columns.
