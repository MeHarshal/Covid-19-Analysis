ðŸ”˜ **Introduction**

This analysis introduces a well-designed dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of key COVID-19 metrics on a global scale. The dashboard offers real-time updates on infection rates, vaccination progress, hospitalization and healthcare capacity, testing and positivity rates, and global travel restrictions. With its user-friendly interface and interactive visualizations, this dashboard serves as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations seeking to track and understand the impact of the pandemic worldwide.

ðŸ”˜ **Aim of the study**

The aim of this study is to create a uniquely designed dashboard that offers a concise and comprehensive overview of key COVID-19 metrics, providing individuals and organizations with a powerful tool to track and understand the global impact of the pandemic.

ðŸ”˜ **Data Source**

The data source for this project is Kaggle.com, a popular platform for sharing and discovering datasets. The specific dataset used for this project provides information on the worldwide COVID-19 situation up until 2021. The dataset on Kaggle.com is likely to have been contributed by various sources, such as government agencies, research organizations, or data enthusiasts, and may have undergone preprocessing or consolidation to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact globally. It is important to refer to the dataset's documentation and metadata for further details on its origin, methodology, and any limitations or biases that may exist.

ðŸ”˜ **Data Description**

The provided CSV contains data with the following columns:

1. Continent: Represents the continent to which a particular country belongs.
2. Country: Indicates the name of the country within the corresponding continent.
3. Population: Represents the population of the continent to which the country belongs.
4. Cases Found by Month: Provides the number of COVID-19 cases found in each month.
5. Deaths: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19.
6. Age: Indicates the age range in which the COVID-19 virus is spreading.
7. Year: Represents the year for which the data is recorded.

This dataset offers information on the COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and demographic factors such as age, organized by continent and country. It provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on different regions, allowing for analysis and insights into the spread of the virus across various demographic groups and geographical locations.

ðŸ”˜ **Methodolgy**

The analysis methodology consists of data cleaning to address any inconsistencies, followed by visualizations such as charts and maps are then utilized to present the data effectively. Comparative analysis is conducted to understand variations across continents and countries, while time-series analysis is performed to uncover trends and patterns over time.
